# EVENT_DETECTION_USING_ML_MODELS
### Implemented NLP Techniques:
Utilized Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF for feature extraction from news articles to transform text data into numerical representations.
### Model Development: 
Trained and compared various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to identify and extract noteworthy events.
### Achieved High Accuracy: 
The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 98% in detecting events from the news articles.
